# MiniProject 4

Robotics 1, Professor John Wen

Proj4 will run the whole thing
However, Individual parts are broken out
Kincheck makes sure that different methods of finding the inverse kinematics make sure that the solution converges to the desired pose
error metric, does not work because invkin_iterJ_kth does not work. 
Jacobian comparision compares jacobioan 
parameter finder looks at how different parameters affect convergance
