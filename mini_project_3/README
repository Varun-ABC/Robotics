proj3.m is the main file where all code is executed. To execute the whole thing, press the green arrow. 
However, for ease, it is split up in section which can be run independently, given that the initial set up section (section 1) has been run.
The inverse kinematics is done out of proj3.m in invkin_6DOF.m
